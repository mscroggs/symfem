"""Demo showing how Symfem can be used to verify properties of a basis.

The polynomial set of a degree k Nedelec first kind space is:
{polynomials of degree < k} UNION {polynomials of degree k such that p DOT x = 0}.

The basis functions of a Nedelec first kind that are associated with the interior of the cell
have 0 tangential component on the facets of the cell.

In this demo, we verify that these properties hold for a degree 4 Nedelec first kind
space on a triangle.
